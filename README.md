Registration Form for Showcasing

## Registration Form for Showcasing

This was an experimental project where a form from a web app was developed using Flutter. The data from the app is collected and then sent
to a Firestore database. Below are some screenshots of the app. The form was also made responsive to display properly on
mobile devices.



The initial look of the form.
